Introduction
============

The **irace** package implements the Iterated Race method, which is a
generalization of the Iterated F-race method for the automatic configuration of
optimization algorithms, that is, the tuning of their parameters by finding the
most appropriate settings given a set of instances of an optimization problem.
It builds upon the race package by Birattari and it is implemented in R.

**Keywords:** automatic configuration, offline tuning, parameter tuning, racing, F-race.

Requisites
----------

 * R (<https://www.r-project.org>) is required for running irace, but
   you don't need to know the R language to use it.


User guide
----------

A complete [user guide](https://cran.r-project.org/package=irace/vignettes/irace-package.pdf)
comes with the package. You can access it online or, after installing the irace
package, invoking from R the following command:

```R
        R> vignette("irace-package")
```

The following is a quick-start guide. The user guide gives more detailed
instructions.

Installing R
============

The official instructions are available at
<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html>. We give below
a quick R installation guide that will work in most cases.

GNU/Linux
---------

You should install R from your package manager. On a Debian/Ubuntu system it
will be something like:

    $ sudo apt-get install r-base

Once R is installed, you can launch R from the Terminal and from the R
prompt install the irace package. See instructions below.


OS X
----

You can install R directly from a CRAN mirror
(<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>).

Alternatively, if you use homebrew, you can just brew the R formula
from the science tap (unfortunately it does not come already bottled
so you need to have Xcode installed to compile it):

```bash
    $ brew tap homebrew/science
    $ brew install r
```

Once R is installed, you can launch R from the Terminal (or from your
Applications), and from the R prompt install the irace package. See
instructions below.

Windows
-------

You can install R from a CRAN mirror
(<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/>). Once R is installed, you can
launch the R console and install the irace package from it. See instructions
below.


Installing the irace package
============================

There are two methods for installing the [irace](http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/irace) R package on your
computer:

1. Install within R (automatic download):
```R
        $ R
        R> install.packages("irace")
```
   select a mirror close to you, and test the installation with
```R
        R> library(irace)
        R> CTRL+d
```

2. Manually
   [download the package from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=irace)
   and invoke at the command-line:
```bash
        $ R CMD INSTALL <package>
```
   where `<package>` is one of the three versions available: `.tar.gz`
   (Unix/BSD/GNU/Linux), `.tgz` (MacOS X), or `.zip` (Windows).


If the package fails to install because of insufficient permissions,
you need to force a *local installation* by doing:
```bash
    $ mkdir ~/R
    $ R CMD INSTALL --library=~/R irace.tar.gz
    $ export R_LIBS=~/R:${R_LIBS}
```

Once installed, test that it is working by doing:
```R
    $ R
    R> library(irace)
    R> system.file(package="irace")
    [1] "~/R/irace"
```
The last command tells you the installation directory of `irace`.

GNU/Linux and OS X
------------------

Save the installation directory of `irace` to a variable, and add it to your
`.bash_profile`, `.bashrc` or `.profile`:

```bash
    export IRACE_HOME=~/R/irace/ # Path given by system.file(package="irace")
    export PATH=${IRACE_HOME}/bin/:$PATH
    # export R_LIBS=~/R:${R_LIBS} # Only if local installation was forced
```

After adding this and opening a new terminal, you should be able to
invoke `irace` as follows:

```bash
    $ irace --help
```


Windows
-------

If the installation directory of `irace` is `C:/R/irace/`, you can invoke
`irace` by opening a terminal (launch the program `cmd.exe`) and executing:

```bash
    C:\> C:\R\irace\bin\x64\irace.exe --help
```

or if you are in a 32-bits system, executing:

```bash
    C:\> C:\R\irace\bin\i386\irace.exe --help
```

You can also launch irace by opening the R console and executing:

```R
    R> library(irace)
    R> irace.cmdline("--help")
```

Usage
=====

1. Create a directory for storing the tuning scenario setup
```bash
        $ mkdir ~/tuning
        $ cd ~/tuning
```

2. Copy the template and example files to the scenario directory
```bash
        $ cp $IRACE_HOME/templates/*.tmpl .
```

    where `$IRACE_HOME` is the path to the installation directory of
    `irace`. It can be obtained by doing:

```R
        $ R
        > library(irace)
        > system.file(package="irace")
```

3. For each template in your tuning directory, remove the `.tmpl`
   suffix, and modify them following the instructions in each file. In
   particular,
    * The scripts `target-runner` and `target-evaluator` (if you need it at all)
      should be executable. The output of `target-runner` (or
      `target-evaluator` if you use a separate evaluation step) is minimized by
      default. If you wish to maximize it, just multiply the value by `-1`
      within the script.
    * In `scenario.txt`, uncomment and assign only the parameters for which
      you need a value different than the default one.
   
    There are examples in `$IRACE_HOME/examples/`.

4. Put the instances in `~/tuning/Instances/`. In addition, you can
   create a file that specifies which instances from that directory
   should be run and which instance-specific parameters to use. See
   `scenario.txt.tmpl` and `instances-list.tmpl` for examples. The command
   irace will not attempt to create the execution directory (`execDir`),
   so it must exist before calling irace. The default `execDir` is the
   current directory.

5. Calling the command:
```bash
        $ cd ~/tuning/ && $IRACE_HOME/bin/irace
```

    performs one run of Iterated Race. See the output of `irace --help` for
    additional irace parameters. Command-line parameters override the
    scenario setup specified in the `scenario.txt` file.


Many tuning runs in parallel
----------------------------

For executing several repetitions of irace in parallel, call the
program

```bash
    $ cd ~/tuning/ && $IRACE_HOME/bin/parallel-irace N
```

where N is the number of repetitions. By default, the execution directory of
each run of irace will be set to `./execdir-dd`, where `dd` is a number padded
with zeroes.

**Be careful**, `parallel-irace` will create these directories from
scratch, deleting them first if they already exist.

Check the help of `parallel-irace` by running it without parameters.


Parallelize one tuning
----------------------

A single run of irace can be done much faster by executing the calls
to `targetRunner` (the runs of the algorithm being tuned) in
parallel. See the [user guide](https://cran.r-project.org/package=irace/vignettes/irace-package.pdf) for the details.
